```
## Development

This repository contains a number of demos/examples. You can use them to locally test your changes.

```bash
cd examples
npm setup
npm run dev
```

## Releasing (maintainers)

Every user-visible change needs a changeset: run `npx changeset` from the repo
root in the same PR, pick the bump level (`patch` is for bug fixes only, new API
surface is `minor`) and commit the file it writes under `.changeset/`. That is
where the changelog entry comes from, and it is where the bump level is decided
— not on release day. See [`.changeset/README.md`](.changeset/README.md).

To release, from an up-to-date, clean `master`, run `npm run release`. It
builds and tests, applies the pending changesets — bumping the version and
writing `CHANGELOG.md` — publishes to npm, and only then tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes,
and creates a GitHub release whose notes come straight from that changelog
entry. An interrupted release is resumed by re-running it, never undone. Use
`npm run release:next` for a prerelease under the `next` dist-tag.

The script is
[`@datocms/release-toolchain`](https://github.com/datocms/release-toolchain),
shared with every other DatoCMS repository and pinned here by tag.

## Trying a change before it's released

Every push to a branch here publishes a preview of the package, which you can
install anywhere — no npm release, no `npm link`:

```
npm i https://pkg.pr.new/datocms/vue-datocms@<commit-sha>
```

The exact URL shows up in the commit's check run on GitHub, and in a comment on
the pull request once there is one. This is the supported way to try a change
inside a site that lives in another repository, or to hand a fix to whoever
reported it before it is released.

Previews are throwaway: they are never published to npm, and the URL stops
resolving after a while. Never commit one to a `package.json` that ships.
